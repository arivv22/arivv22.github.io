I am a backend engineer with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and research-oriented problem solving.

This blog serves as a personal knowledge base where I write about AI/ML concepts, system design decisions, and reflections from reading research papers, 
as part of my preparation for graduate studies.

Focus Areas

- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

- System Design for ML Applications

- Research-oriented technical writing

- Preparation for graduate studies (AI / Embodied Intelligence)
